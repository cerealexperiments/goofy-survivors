## Goofy Survivors
A top-down shooter game where you have to survive as long as possible against waves of enemies. The game is made in Godot 4.

#### Why **Goofy and why Survivors**?
**Goofy** - because the game sprites are quite silly and the developer is a goofy ahh "person".
**Survivors** - because I took inspiration from Vampire Survivors.

The game is still in development, and the current version is a prototype. Features like waves, weapon choice, different enemy types are not implemented yet (I've only spent 2 days learning Godot and developing this game).
